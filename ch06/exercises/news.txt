Athens, Ga. – University of Georgia Greek Life has found a new way to support an outside organization that is serving the Athens community.
Greek Life is partnering with The Blood Connection, a nonprofit organization that takes the unique approach of hosting blood drives that directly benefit health care providers in the community where the drives take place.
Therefore, UGA blood drives conducted through the Blood Connection provide blood to Piedmont-Athens Regional Hospital, one of the Blood Connection’s health care partners. 
UGA Greek Life has sponsored three blood drives through the Blood Connection and plans to host quarterly events with the organization.
“The real draw to partner with the Blood Connection was to benefit our community here at home,” said Josh Welch, UGA’s director of Greek Life. “We are early in our relationship, but I hope to grow it moving forward.”
Their most recent blood drive, held on March 15, aimed to host 72 donors and exceeded that goal with 111 completed donations. 
With each donation supporting three patients, the March blood drive will make a difference in more than 300 community members’ lives. 
The previous two events sponsored by Greek Life saw 189 total donors.
